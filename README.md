# WhoIsHuman
A guessing game of which person is real. 

Nine cards of individuals are presented with only one being an actual person. Simply guess which is real to earn a point.

This first push includes a functioning registration for new users as well presents generated faces, names, and pulls an age catergory as well as occupation from a premade list which corralates to a facial recognition API's response. 

To do:
The url source for the images is an API that is causing the main bottleneck for the games loading time. May simply switch to local files.
Names, jobs and ages need to be dialed in for more accuaracy based on the Clarifai API.
