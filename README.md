# WhoIsHuman
A guessing game of which person is real. 

Nine cards of persons are presented with only one being an actual person. Simply guess which is real to earn a point.

This first push includes a functioning registration for new users as well presents generated faces, names, and pulls an age catergory as well as occupation from a premade list which corralates to a facial recognition API's response. 

Lots to do!
